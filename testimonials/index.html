                    i learned were current, if not more so in the company i joined. I honestly feel i got every penny's
                    worth.

                        to make a transition and i have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free 
                        intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was te best - and most grueling -
                        time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a software engineer at a VR startup."

                    <span class="opacity70">"Before joining the bootcamp I had never written a line of code. I needed a structure from 
                        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can say 
                        wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not dissappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                        The agile team project, in particular was very outstanding. it took my learning to a next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. Infact i have often
                        referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It helped me land a job as full-stack developer after receiving 
                        offers. 100% recommend!

                    <span class="opacity70">"The staff seem genuinely concerned abiut my progress which i find really refreshing. The program gave me the
                        confidence necessary to be able to go out to the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is
                        above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredibly community of smart and amazing people."</span></p>
